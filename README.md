# Traffic-Sign Classification
This was developed as a part of the traffic sign recognition project done under Dr. Deepika Kukreja, NSUT.

## About
1. The train.py file consists of the model developed in Keras.
2. The test.py file consists of using the trained model weights to predict on the test data.
3. The test_visualise.py consists of the code used to prepare the demo. The demo takes in an input image and detects the type of road-sign (out of 47 categories).
